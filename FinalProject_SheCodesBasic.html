      <p>
        In the bustling streets and quiet corners, a silent struggle unfolds
        every day, unseen by many. Stray cats and dogs navigate a challenging
        existence, where survival is a constant battle against hunger, disease,
        and the harsh elements. Abandoned by fate or circumstances, these
        resilient creatures forge a life on the fringes of human society,
        scavenging for sustenance amidst the shadows of indifference.

      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        We are a community of volunteers based in Jakarta and Bali, Indonesia,
        who love animals and care about their welfare. The rising population of
        stray cats and dogs is a pressing concern that echoes the silent
        suffering of those animals. Only through collective actions we can hope
        to alleviate the suffering, ensuring a more compassionate and
        sustainable coexistence between humans and animals. <br /><em
          ><strong>
            We would love to connect and collaborate with any other communities,
            volunteers, or organizations who have the same mission with us, in
            any part of the world. 🌍</strong

      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <h4>Street Feeding and Education</h4>
      <p>
        Our regular program to visit different locations with high population of
        stray animals, to feed them while educating the locals about animal
        welfare. During our visit we are usually accompanied by a veterinarian
        from one of our partnering pet clinics. This program is sometimes
        combined with our vaccination program for stray animals. Anyone is
        welcome to join us on this program.

      <h4>Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR)</h4>
      <p>
        Our special program as a part of the humane and effective strategy in
        the ongoing battle against the overpopulation of stray animals
        (especially cats).This method involves trapping, spaying or neutering
        while providing them with veterinary care and ear tipping, and then
        returning them to their original. We always welcome new volunteers for
        this program. If you are interested, and you are comfortable with stray
        cats and dogs, please let us know.
